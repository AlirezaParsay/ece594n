# Guidelines

- Read the research paper.
- Download the data and the code.
- Try reproducing the figures of the paper using their published data and code.
- Create a new folder in this folder with the name of your team. In this new folder:
  - Add the Jupyter notebook that represents your analysis' report.
  - Make sure to indicate which teammate did which part of the work.
  - You can submit code to this repository anytime until the deadline.
- The Jupyter notebook should indicate whether it was easy to reproduce the results.
  - Record the time it took you to do tasks.
  - If you do not get the same figures as the paper, this is fine.
- Present in class on Thursday 05/03/2022 (5 min per team).
